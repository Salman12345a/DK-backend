# Environment Variable Instructions

The affiliate products feature uses the following environment variables from your `.env` file:

```
S3_AFFILIATE_BUCKET=dokirana-affiliate-bucket
AWS_REGION_AFFILIATE=ap-south-1
```

These variables are already configured in your environment, so no additional setup is required.

The feature also uses the existing AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_KEY) that are already configured in your environment.
